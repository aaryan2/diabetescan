# diabetescan
A diabetes diagnosing tool made with the pima indians diabetes dataset and a tensorflow linear classifier

This is a relatively simple diagnosis tool for Type 2 Diabetes, taking in eight inputs and one output (positive or negative)
In the future, softmax should be applied to create a probabibilistic model for more insight into the diagnosis. This model uses a 
multiple binary linear classifier (MBLC) and is trained on 500 epochs.
